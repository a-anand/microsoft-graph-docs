### Supported scope queries for accessReviewHistoryDefinition

The following are queries supported on an [accessReviewHistoryDefinition](../resources/accessreviewhistorydefinition.md) based on the [accessreviewqueryscope](../resources/accessreviewqueryscope.md). These scopes dictate which type of review history data is included in the downloadable CSV file which is generated when the definition is created.

|Scenario| Query |
|--|--|
| Include every `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` review result on individual groups (excludes definitions scoped to all Microsoft 365 groups with guest users) | /identityGovernance/accessReviews/definitions?$filter=contains(scope/query, '/groups')" |
| Include every `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` review result on a specific group (excludes definitions scoped to all Microsoft 365 groups with guest users) | /identityGovernance/accessReviews/definitions?$filter=contains(scope/query, '/groups/{group id}') |
| Include every `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` review result scoped to all Microsoft 365 groups with guest users | /identityGovernance/accessReviews/definitions?$filter=contains(scope/query, './members') |
| Include every `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` review result on an access package | /identityGovernance/accessReviews/definitions?$filter=contains(scope/query, 'accessPackageAssignments') |
| Include every `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` review result for service principals assigned to privileged role | /identityGovernance/accessReviews/definitions?$filter=contains(scope/query, 'roleAssignmentScheduleInstances') |
| Include every `accessReviewScheduleDefinition` review result for reivews of a specific group | /identityGovernance/accessReviews/definitions?$filter=scope/query eq '/groups/a1382a9b-8320-4e9c-8f73-dfead37d7723/members' |
